Our project is designed to keep a check on all the outgoing students, of the hostel. This module automates the security system at the gates of the school, safely secures all the information and keeps a record of all the relevant details like, the name of the student, purpose for going out of the college, the name of the person who permitted the student to leave, time and date when the out pass was issued.  
Job Officer Outing Pass System makes the process easy and complete automatic. Like if a students want to go for an outing then he can generate a request from his/her mobile through internet system. The request automatic send a SMS to his parents with complete details. After that Hostel Warden can approve or reject the request for outing. Again a confirmation message will shoot to parents and students. If the request is confirm, when a student leave campus , we put a check on gate where security guard on their computer approve or reject the request with a very simple user friendly screen.
